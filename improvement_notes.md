Sample needs to be clicked multiple times.

Need to explain why they are writing this down
learning out come is how to record data

Sampling has nothing to do with steps, just distance

- Click 'sample' too many times and you lose the info.

- What do you do at the end? Click 'Reset'

- Do not click too quickly (you'll miss something)

- Do not make your transect too small

- Motivate with "This is how people actually count elephants"

Bu Maisels (Kate's colleague) has used this technique (dung transects). Need to be rigid about it. Widest ever survey.

Add "can move to data analysis" at end of online simulation sampling.
