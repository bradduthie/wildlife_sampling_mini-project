abstract = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal popu- lations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abun- dance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.},

abstract = {African forest elephants- taxonomically and functionally unique-are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002-2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.},

abstract = {Monitoring carnivores is critical for conservation, yet challenging because they are rare and elusive. Few methods exist for monitoring wide-ranging species over large spatial and sufficiently long temporal scales to detect trends. Remote cameras are an emerging technology for monitoring large carnivores around the world because of their low cost, non-invasive methodology, and their ability to capture pictures of species of concern that are difficult to monitor. For species without uniquely identifiable spots, stripes, or other markings, cameras collect detection/non-detection data that are well suited for monitoring trends in occupancy as its own independent useful metric of species distribution, as well as an index for abundance. As with any new monitoring method, prospective power analysis is essential to ensure meaningful trends can be detected. Here we test camera-based occupancy models as a method to monitor changes in occupancy of a threatened species, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), at large landscape scales, across 5 Canadian national parks ($\sim$ 21,000 km2). With n = 183 cameras, the top occupancy model estimated regional occupancy to be 0.79 across all 5 parks. We evaluate the statistical power to detect simulated 5–40% declines in occupancy between two sampling years and test applied questions of how power is affected by the spatial scale of interest (park level vs. regional level), the number of cameras deployed, and duration of camera deployment. We also explore several ecological mechanisms (i.e., spatial patterns) of decline in occupancy, and examine how power changes when focusing only on grizzly bears family groups. As hypothesized, statistical power increased with the number of cameras and with the number of days deployed. Power was unaffected, however, by the ecological mechanisms of decline, indicating that our systematic sampling design can detect a decline regardless of whether occupancy declined due to range edge attrition, ecological trap or other mechanisms. Despite their lower occupancy, power was similarly high for grizzly bear family groups compared to grizzly bears in general. We highlight which study design attributes contributed to high power and we provide advice for establishing cost-effective camera-based programs for monitoring large carnivore occupancy at large spatial scales.},

abstract = {Setting up effective conservation strategies requires the precise determination of the targeted species' distribution area and, if possible, its local abundance. However, detection issues make these objectives complex for most vertebrates. The detection probability is usually <1 and is highly dependent on species phenology and other environmental variables. The aim of this study was to define an optimized survey protocol for the Mediterranean amphibian community, that is, to determine the most favorable periods and the most effective sampling techniques for detecting all species present on a site in a minimum number of field sessions and a minimum amount of prospecting effort. We visited 49 ponds located in the Languedoc region of southern France on four occasions between February and June 2011. Amphibians were detected using three methods: nighttime call count, nighttime visual encounter, and daytime netting. The detection nondetection data obtained was then modeled using site-occupancy models. The detection probability of amphibians sharply differed between species, the survey method used and the date of the survey. These three covariates also interacted. Thus, a minimum of three visits spread over the breeding season, using a combination of all three survey methods, is needed to reach a 95% detection level for all species in the Mediterranean region. Synthesis and applications: detection nondetection surveys combined to site occupancy modeling approach are powerful methods that can be used to estimate the detection probability and to determine the prospecting effort necessary to assert that a species is absent from a site.},

abstract = {Reliable assessments of species' status are prerequisites for monitoring the success of conservation programmes. However, survey conditions such as terrain and inaccessibility, compounded by the low densities of many species across Southeast Asia and other parts of the world are considerable barriers to obtaining robust populations estimates. We used an occupancy-based approach and multi-model inference to generate occupancy and abundance estimates for northern white-cheeked crested gibbons Nomascus leucogenys and southern white-cheeked crested gibbons N. siki in the Nam Kading National Protected Area (NKNPA) in central Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic (hereafter Laos). We present these estimates for gibbons within the context of a strategy designed to monitor multiple species and discuss the practical challenges to obtaining sufficient data for robust population estimates to detect change in gibbon status over time. We surveyed approximately 210km2 of habitat and estimate an abundance of 45 (SE=17, CV=37%) groups, giving an average site abundance of 0.21 (SE=0.08, CV=37%) groups per km2. We make recommendations for ongoing gibbon monitoring and discuss the wider implications for cost effective wildlife monitoring in Laos.},

abstract = {Summary In Thailand, as for most of South-East Asia, large vertebrates are declining rapidly due to habitat degradation and increasing hunting pressure. Once relatively common in the evergreen forest of Southern Thailand, the Great Argus Argusianus argus is currently limited to a few populations, whose status is currently unknown. In this study we investigated changes in Great Argus abundance over the past 13 years in Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary. Our aim was to estimate and compare the abundance and density of this species from an earlier two-year survey in 2001-2002 and ours in 2014, and to assess the effect of landscape change on its status of the species. We conducted surveys from March to August 2014 during the breeding season. We placed point counts that overlapped the line transects from the 2001-2002 survey. The results indicated a decline of > 35% in mean abundance from 2001 to 2014. In addition, male abundance has shifted and is now positively related to distance from the forest edge. High levels of human disturbance close to the forest edge may have resulted in the birds moving to the core of the forest, suggesting a need to increase protection and management of forest edge areas. In common with other studies of large vertebrates, our results confirm the importance of long-term studies to highlight the negative effects of human disturbance.},
